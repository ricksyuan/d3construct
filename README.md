# d3construct
Visual deconstruction of data and algorithms using D3.

### Background

Linear regression is a common statistical technique used to make predictions given an input variable. For example, one might predict the amount of ice cream sales based off temperature.

### Functionality & MVP

D3construct is an interactive tool allowing users to visualize data and algorithms. For a linear regression, the user is able to:

- [ ] Click on the scatter plot to add data
- [ ] View the predicted line of best fit once there are two are more points
- [ ] Visualize the difference between the predicted line and plotted points
- [ ] Drag points to new locations
- [ ] Remove points by clicking on them

### Architecture and Technologies

This project is implemented primarily with `D3` to manipulate and render data and vanilla `Javascript`.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: 
- Become familiar with D3 setup and basic manipulation of elements

**Day 2**: 
- Show scatter plot with axes

**Day 3**:
- Add and remove points to scatter plot

**Day 4**:
- Zoom and pan on graph

**Day 5**:
- Display linear regression

### Bonus features

- [ ] Have ability to view residuals
- [ ] Allow user to provide data through csv or json format

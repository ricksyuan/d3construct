# d3construct
Visual deconstruction of a correlation analysis using D3.

### Background

Correlation analysis is a common statistical technique measuring the association between two variables. For example, there is a correlation between temperature and ice cream consumption. The hotter it is, the greater the consumption of ice cream. 

### Functionality & MVP

D3construct is an interactive tool allowing users to visualize each aspect of a correlation analysis. The user will be able to:

- [ ] Plot provided sets of 2-dimensional points on a scatter plot
- [ ] View the mean for each dimension
- [ ] Visualize the covariance between the two variables
- [ ] Calculate standard deviation for each variable
- [ ] View the calculated correlation statistic on the scatter plot

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented primarily with `D3` to manipulate and render data and vanilla `Javascript`.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: 
- Familiarize with setting up and using D3 and basic manipulation of elements

**Day 2**: 
- Have ability to input points on a scatter plot with axes

**Day 3**:
- Have ability to show mean for each variable

**Day 4**:
- Have ability to display boxes showing each point's contribution to covariance

**Day 5**:
- Have ability to show correlation with smooth transitions

### Bonus features

- [ ] Allow user to pull data from various API
- [ ] Allow user to delete or add points
